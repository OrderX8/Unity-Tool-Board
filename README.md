## How to install package

1. Find your Unity game's folder
2. Open the folder called "Packages"
3. Open up the "manifest.json" file
4. Using any text/code editor scroll all the way down and add this:

```
"com.orderx8.unitytoolboard":"https://github.com/OrderX8/Unity-Tool-Board.git"
```

It should look something like this:
```
{
  "dependencies": {
    "com.unity.something.somethingelse": "1.0.0",
    "com.unity.othersomething": "1.0.0", <- Don't forget this comma!
    "com.orderx8.unitytoolboard": "https://github.com/OrderX8/Unity-Tool-Board.git"
  }
}
```

5. Open up the Unity Editor of your game and done!
